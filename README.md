# Multiple linear regression implementation in numpy
This is my homework solution to the MAC0460 - Intro to machine learning course.

I implement multiple linear regression from scratch using only numpy.

Also I perform an exploratory data analysis on a dataset that has the features "Sex",	"Age",	"Height",	"Weight",	"Shoe number",	"Trouser number" which was shared in class and I don't have the permission to post.
